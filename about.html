    <h2>About My Project</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I’m the creator of the International Relations Timeline, a project I kicked off because I’ve always been fascinated by how the world’s history is shaped by diplomacy, conflicts, treaties, and everything in between. I wanted to build something that brings all these events together in one place, making it easy for anyone to dive into the past and see how it connects to today.</p>
    
    <h3>Why I Started This</h3>
    <p>I’ve always had an interest in history, and one day, I thought, “Why not create a timeline that maps out these events, from the 1400s to now, in a way that’s visual and interactive?” So, I started this project to scratch that itch, hoping to share my passion with others who are curious about global relations.</p>
    
    <h3>Where the Data Comes From</h3>
    <p>I pull data from sources like the United Nations and government sites, but what makes this project special is the community. People like you can add events, and I make sure everything is backed by solid sources and info.</p>
    
    <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
    <p>This timeline is a living project, and I’d love for you to be part of it! If you know of an event that belongs here, head over to the <a href="contribute.html">Contribute</a> page. Just fill out the form with the details, and I’ll review it to make sure it fits. It’s a team effort to keep this thing growing.</p>
