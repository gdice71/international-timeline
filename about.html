    <h2>About the International Relations Timeline</h2>
    <p>The International Relations Timeline is a comprehensive, open-source project dedicated to documenting significant events in global history, with a focus on international relations, diplomacy, conflicts, treaties, and more. Our mission is to provide an accessible and accurate resource for students, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore the interconnected history of nations and regions.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
    <p>This timeline captures pivotal moments from the 1400s to the present, organized by decade, region, and category. By presenting events in a visual and interactive format, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of how historical events shape the modern world.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>Our data is sourced from reputable organizations such as the United Nations, Wikipedia, and contributions from our community of users. All events are supported by primary sources, ensuring reliability and verifiability.</p>
    
    <h3>Contribute to the Timeline</h3>
    <p>We welcome contributions from the public to keep the timeline up-to-date and comprehensive. Users can submit events through our <a href="contribute.html">Contribute</a> page, where submissions are reviewed by our admin team before being added to the timeline. Each submission requires a headline, description, date, region, category, and optional primary sources for validation.</p>
