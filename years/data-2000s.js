      summary: "The Iraq War commenced on March 19, 2003, when a U.S.-led coalition, primarily comprising forces from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, initiated military operations against Iraq. The primary objectives were to dismantle Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and liberate the Iraqi people from his authoritarian regime."
