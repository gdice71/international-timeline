Following the conflict, Russia formally recognized the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a move that heightened regional instability and strained international relations."

      summary: "The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, marking the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at the time. Triggered by a subprime mortgage crisis, the failure of Lehman Brothers led to a severe liquidity crisis, causing widespread panic in global financial markets. Stock markets plummeted, credit froze, and major economies entered a deep recession. Governments and central banks worldwide responded with unprecedented bailouts and monetary policy interventions to stabilize the financial system. The crisis exposed vulnerabilities in global finance, leading to long-term regulatory reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act."

It amended the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, introducing key changes: a permanent EU Council President, a strengthened European Parliament with expanded legislative powers, simplified Qualified Majority Voting, and a single legal personality for the EU to act globally. Negotiated through the 2007 Intergovernmental Conference under Portugal’s EU Presidency, the treaty aimed to improve democratic legitimacy and institutional effectiveness following the rejected Constitutional Treaty. It was signed by EU leaders and entered into force on December 1, 2009, after ratification by all member states."
