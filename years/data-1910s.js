        summary: "The Treaty of Versailles was the peace agreement signed on June 28, 1919, that officially ended World War I between Germany and the Allied Powers. The treaty imposed severe terms on Germany, including accepting full responsibility for the war (the war guilt clause), paying large reparations, surrendering significant territories to neighboring countries, losing all overseas colonies, and drastically reducing its military capabilities. It also established the League of Nations, an international organization aimed at maintaining peace and preventing future conflicts."
